### Project Takeaways

This current iteration is not the "final" form of the portfolio website. The final website is a React Page that is currently "under construction". This portfolio page represents the beginning point for my abilities in shaping and directing JS/CSS/HTML. It serves as a foundation of knowledge, poking at the different 
functionalities and features within Web Development.
